# flow-do

A firebase enabled, flowing todo list. Written using the [Phaser](http://phaser.io) game engine, and making use of [TinyColor](https://github.com/bgrins/TinyColor), and [TurfJS](http://turfjs.org/).

Click to create a new todo item, or drag the white dot to add a todo that depends on the first one being done.

Clicking on a todo selects it, and highlights any tasks that must be completed first. Hitting enter toggles a todo between done, and not done. Hitting backspace deletes it.

To edit a todo, double click it.

Click the twitter button in the top right to log in, and persist your todo list.

Todos you can do right now, are green.
